To run in developer mode - In a terminal 
    npm run dev

To run more like how it will be deployed 
    npm run build
    npm run preview

To set up the Release stuff (from Github Releases and Github Pages)
 
    Went to 
        https://github.com/vancem/CallerBuddy/settings/pages
    And Set 'Build and Deployment' source to 'Github Actions'

The file 
    .github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml 
    Tells GIT to do some things when release are pushed to main.
