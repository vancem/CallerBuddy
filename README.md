# CallerBuddy

CallerBuddy is a tool for square dance callers to manage a collection of music
(MP3 files) and Lyrics (HTML or MD files) so they can select songs for a dance,
then play songs and read the associated lyrics during the dance. It is loosely
based on the [sqview](https://www.sqview.se/download.php) program, the general
purpose is the same, but most of the UI details are different.
